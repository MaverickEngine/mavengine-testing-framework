# Adding local themes

If you want to add a theme that is not available in the official themes repository, you can add it to your local theme directory. 

Then add the theme to **WORDPRESS_THEMES** line in the .env file to auto-activate it when the Docker instance starts.

`WORDPRESS_THEMES="dailymaverick-theme"`
